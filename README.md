# TERMINUX
Creating a remote terminal environment in a web application involves setting up a web-based interface that allows users to interact with a terminal session remotely. 
This can be useful for system administration, remote development, education, and other purposes.

# Motivation
This project aims to provide a flexible, secure, and scalable environment for executing terminal commands remotely. It combines the ease of access and management of web applications with the robustness and isolation provided by Docker containers.
